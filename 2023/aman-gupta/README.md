#Introduction

Hi, I am Aman Gupta. I'm currently a pre-final year DSAI student and a freelancer with a passion for full-stack development. In addition, I'm also the President of my college's Development Club, where I mentor and guide other students on software development and programming.

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing esports games such as Valorant and lifting weights at the gym.

I'm particularly interested in contributing to Wagtail for GSoC 2023, as I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for me to learn, grow and make a positive impact in the open-source community. As a full-stack developer, I have a wealth of experience working with technologies such as Django, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which I believe will be very useful in contributing to the Wagtail Project.
